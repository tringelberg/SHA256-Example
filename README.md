# SHA256 Example
A simple but probably not so efficient implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm based on the RFC4634 and the FIPS180-4 documentation.<br>
<br>
This code was originally written for my (small and in progress) coding blog.<br><br>
Please note this code is meant for educational purposes. It should not be used in real production code (C# already offers this functionality).<br>
But I hope it still helps you somehow :)<br><br>
